Effective Date: July 21, 2025 Last Updated: July 21, 2025

LogoAI ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information, specifically regarding our AI-powered features and image processing.

1. Information We Collect and How We Use It
LogoAI does not require user accounts or registration. However, to provide our core services, we process the following data:

User-Provided Images: If you choose to upload or take a photo as a design reference, that image is transmitted to Google Gemini AI for processing.

Purpose: To analyze visual elements and generate a logo based on your reference.

Retention: We do not store your personal photos on our permanent servers. Images are processed in real-time and deleted after the generation is complete.

AI Reporting & Flagging: If you use the in-app reporting feature to flag offensive content, the generated image and your reason for flagging are stored in Firebase so our developers can improve safety filters.

Technical Data: We automatically collect anonymous data such as device model, OS version, and crash logs (via Firebase Crashlytics) to monitor app stability.

2. Third-Party Service Providers (Data Sharing)
To provide AI functionality and app stability, we share specific data with the following trusted providers:

Google Gemini AI: Receives your prompts and uploaded photos to generate designs. This data is subject to the Google Generative AI Terms of Service.

Google Firebase: Used for anonymous analytics, crash reporting, and storing user-submitted content reports.

Google Play Billing: Processes all premium subscriptions. We never see or store your credit card or payment details.

3. Generative AI Disclosure
LogoAI utilizes Google Gemini AI to generate content. By using the app, you acknowledge that:

Content is generated by AI and may occasionally produce unexpected or inaccurate results.

You are provided with an in-app flagging tool to report any content that violates safety standards.

4. Data Retention and Security
Photos: Reference photos are transient and are not kept for longer than is necessary to generate your logo.

Reports: Flagged content reports are kept for as long as necessary to improve our AI safety parameters.

Encryption: All data transmitted between the app and our service providers (Gemini/Firebase) is encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS.

5. Children’s Privacy
LogoAI is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data (such as a photo of themselves), we will delete it immediately.

6. Your Rights and Choices
Permissions: You can grant or revoke access to your Camera and Photos at any time via your device settings.

Prominent Disclosure: The app will always ask for your affirmative consent via a prominent disclosure before your first photo upload.
